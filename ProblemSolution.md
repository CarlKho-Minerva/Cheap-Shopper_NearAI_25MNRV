# Shop Cheap - Find the lowest-priced products on Google Shopping

## Problem Statement
Many consumers struggle to find the best deals online, particularly for specific products like electric scooters. Traditional shopping comparison tools often miss the lowest prices, don't update frequently, or have cluttered interfaces that make finding the best deal difficult.

## Solution Approach
Shop Cheap addresses this problem by leveraging NEAR AI's agent infrastructure to create a streamlined shopping assistant that:
1. Extracts product requirements from natural language queries
2. Generates optimized search queries for Google Shopping's low-to-high price sorting
3. Returns direct links to the cheapest options along with relevant variations
4. Provides a clean, distraction-free interface focused solely on finding the lowest prices

## Technical Architecture

Shop Cheap is built on NEAR AI's agent infrastructure with the following components:

    B --> D[Search Query\nOptimization]
    D <--> E[Google Shopping\nSearch Results]

```

The system uses a carefully engineered prompt to:
1. Extract product requirements from user queries
2. Generate structured search links that sort by lowest price
3. Identify relevant product variations/features that might be important
4. Format results in a clean, user-friendly interface
